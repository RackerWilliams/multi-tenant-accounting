Blueprint Name:

Create a standard for identifying tenants in a multi-tenant OpenStack
deployment

Description:

As a cloud computing platform, OpenStack needs to support the concept
of multi-tenancy. A common definition of a ‘tenant’ across services is
necessary to be able to correlate usage tracking, auditing,
authorization, etc… Within each multi-tenant service, the ability to
identify each tenant’s resources (for various reasons such as
security, accounting, isolation, etc…) is also key. However, the
definition of a ‘tenant’ can vary significantly between deployments
and for different operators. This blueprint therefore proposes a
lightweight standard for how to identify tenants in an OpenStack
deployment.

What is a tenant?

a tenant is an arbitrary string used to organize a collection of
resources within a container or identify them as a group.
